A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## memo

I recently installed LazyVim and used the LazyExtras command to enable some additional
features. The configuration seems to be working well with this setup.
However, there are certain prerequisites for its proper functioning:

- Python should be installed, and pynvim needs to be set up.
- Nodejs is required (I used nvm to install Nodejs with scoop).
- Go must be installed.
- Rust is a prerequisite.
- Other dependencies include lazygit, fg, rg, gzip, unzip, etc., which I installed
  using Scoop.

To enhance my experience, I made some additional configurations, such as:

- Setting up configurations to install ToggleTerm.nvim and making it compatible with
  pwsh or nu. ~~I use Alacritty instead of Windows Terminal~~.

  BTW, I use wezterm now, it's better.

- Using Codeium as my AI assistant. While Copilot may be more powerful, it's not
  free.
- Trying leetcode.nvim to solve problems in Neovim.
- Adding a translator plugin called Trans.nvim. It took some effort;
  you need to install sqlite.dll manually and add it to the nvim runtime PATH.
  A static dictionary is also required, and you can install it with Trans.nvim after
  adding the directory to change its default configuration. Awesome!
